👨‍💻 I'm a backend developer with a passion for crafting robust solutions in the cloud. While my expertise shines with AWS, I'm open to exploring other cloud providers, eager to expand my horizons. With a focus on Python, SQL, and basic JavaScript skills  I specialize in building scalable architectures that power dynamic applications. My proficiency extends to relational and non-relational databases, and I thrive on implementing infrastructure as code principles for seamless deployments. As I continue to evolve, I'm eager to explore the realms of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, driven by an insatiable curiosity for innovation. 🚀
